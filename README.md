# Java-Sorting-Algo-Visualizer

clone of my python-sortAlgo Visualizer: https://github.com/RomanJ55/SortingAlgoVisualizer

My first Java Project
 - learning Java by re-building my python project
 - using Swing for the GUI
 - exploring Interfaces and Enums
 - using Threading for the visualisations
 - may not be optimal coded(and messy) since I'm still exploring Java and its libraries

Program supports:
 - Soring Algorithms:
   - bubble sort
   - merge sort
   - heap sort
   - quick sort
   - insertion sort
 - visualisation in real time
 - uses custom objects(with a color and value) for the elements in the lists
